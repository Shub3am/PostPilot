## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **CRXJS** - Chrome extension bundler
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Sonner** - Toast notifications

## Known Issues & Limitations

- LinkedIn and Twitter use scraping methods (may break with platform updates)
- Dev.to requires API token and Cloudinary configuration for images
- Image uploads to Dev.to require Cloudinary account (free tier available)
- Posts to LinkedIn need to be relatively short
- Extension currently supports Chrome/Chromium browsers only

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not loading?
- Make sure you're in Developer mode (`chrome://extensions/`)
- Try rebuilding: `pnpm build`
- Clear browser cache and reload the extension
- Check the console for any error messages

### Posts not appearing?
- Verify you're connected to the platform (check Settings tab)
- Ensure you're logged into the platform in the same browser
- For Dev.to, verify your API token is correct
- Check Chrome notifications for any error messages

### Can't upload images to Dev.to?
- Verify your Cloudinary settings are configured correctly
- Ensure your Cloudinary upload preset is set to "unsigned"
- Check that your image is a valid format (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- Verify Cloudinary account has upload quota remaining

### Connection check failing?
- Make sure you're logged into the platform in your browser
- For Dev.to, verify your API token is valid
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Check if the platform's website layout has changed (may affect scraping)
